# shopping-list #

## What is it? ##

This was my attempt at scratching an itch. Every time my wife sends me to the grocery store she would email or text message me the shopping list beforehand. Checking off the items I'd already obtained was awkward, so I decided to create a mobile app that would let me input a batch of items and check them off.
